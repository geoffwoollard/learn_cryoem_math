# Goal
Learn the mathematics of single particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryoEM)

# Why?
We can see living atoms with electrons. Electron microscopes use hundreds of thousands of volts to speed up single electrons to three quarters the speed of light. At such high speeds electrons have picometer wavelengths and can resolve the distances between atoms in biomolecules. Electron cryomicroscopy (cryoEM) won the 2017 Nobel prize in Chemistry, and pharmaceutical companies have invested in this technology for applications like structure based drug design. 

After biochemical sample preparation of a purified biomolecule, two dimensional images are collected on electron microscopes. Images of single biomolecules are very noisy and computer algorithms average tens of thousands to millions of 2D images to reconstruct a 3D discrete scalar map that represents the Coulomb density (what the electron feels). 

Historically cryoEM computational workflows have drawn from digital signal and image processing theory. With the recent popularization of cryoEM, many researchers have entered the field who do not have a strong physics/engineering background and treat algorithms as black boxes. Unfortunately, this can limit their intuition of what data processing strategies might work, or how to troubleshoot when confusing results are generated computationally. Furthermore, there is a growing trend of applied mathematicians, statisticians and computer scientists to approach cryoEM using the familiar methods of their discipline, providing novel breakthroughs. Therefore, a more transparent and pedagogical treatment of the mathematics of single particle electron cryomicroscopy would be welcomed by researchers who analyze cryoEM data and/or develop computational approaches to cryoEM data.

The mathematics of cryoEM spans several disciplines, from the physics of electron microscopes, through digital Fourier transformations, to Bayesian inference and beyond. This broad range of specialties makes the mathematics of cryoEM a challenge to master, and open to contributions from many fields.

In this repo I would like to open up the black box of cryoEM computation, and exhibit the mathematical objects contained inside. Those sufficiently curious and motivated can teach themselves more about cryoEM data processing by playing with simple models in interactive programming notebooks, made publicly available here.

**NB: If there is a particular computational aspect of cryoEM analysis that you are curious about, feel free to request (via [Issues](https://github.com/geoffwoollard/learn_cryoem_math/issues) in this repo) some learning materials. I will do my best to develop some code and data to play with for interactive learning.**

Three basic computer vision problem types are considered: 1. averaring multiple rotations into a single "average rotation", 2. estimating how to convert between frames from multiple rotations pairs (e.g. from calibrated cameras), and 3. estimating mutliple rotations from difference frames from sparse relative rotations between paris of frames.

  * Global alignment of density maps using Bayesian optimization followed by local search. For the Bayesian optimization approach the landscape is fitted with Gaussian processes, and empirical experiments are done with an L2 based voxel loss, and a optimal transport W1-wavelet approximation (so fast to evaluate). The local search uses a Nelder-Mead, and a L2 based loss performs empirically better (for the local refinement) than W1. The authors discuss why, and discuss around how things could fail for heterogeneous maps. A distance suitable for aligning heterogeneous maps is left to future work.
  * The contributions of this paper go beyond using W1, and include a whole BO optimizaiton approach for a global search for optimal rotation. In particular, see section "3.2 Gaussian Process Interpolant as Surrogate".

  * Experimental characterizatoin of the Medipix2, originally a high energy particle physics detector, and repositioned to detection electrons in TEM. They derive a simple and useful analytical result of the DQE (at zero spatial frequency) for counting detectors. It perhaps could be modified for other intermadiate spatial frequencies. They investigate the effect of threshold energy (to call a count) on the DQE with Monte Carlo simulations, and suggest a threshold of half the incident energy (e.g. 100 keV for a 200 keV scope). Dong MC simulations allows them to investigate how many pixels are being miscounted through backscattering, or would not be observed experimentally (the number of zero count events).

  * Rigerous and pedagogical (and not too long) overview of how to measure modulation transfer function (MTF), noise power spectrum (NPS), detective quantum efficiency (DQE) from images (knife method). Analytical results for edge spread function, line spread function given which are derived/presented in more detail in references (textbooks, etc); see equations 10-13. special care is taken for DQE(w=0), because there is much noise in the NPS at low spatial frequency and the MTF can drop off quickly at low spatial frequency. Methods to measure the NPS from the difference of digitized frames is presented. All this theory is used to compare film, CCD, Medipix2 (hybrid pixel detector) and a MAPS (monolithic active pixel sensor) detector. For detectors (such as MAPS) that can distinguish individual electron events, one can calculate the DQE from the probability density of the energy (Landau plot), although this density is hard to estimate. The authors do Monte Carlo simulations at two levels of theory (“continuous slowing down approximation”, and another they call “Full Monte Carlo” that treats both elastic and inelastic collisions as stochastic), and give references to a previous study and a textbook. Using this theory they simulate electron trajectories, deposited energy, and the resulting image in film, and MAPS. They are then able connect detector performance (DQE, etc) to physical/causal explanations, and suggest how to make the ideal detector. History has vindicated their calls for how to make a detector of choice.

### 2D Classification
* Rao, R., Moscovich, A., & Singer, A. (2020). Wasserstein K-Means for Clustering Tomographic Projections, (2016), 1–11.
  * The authors use a displacement/transport based loss, in place of the typical pixel based loss (e.g. L2). They propose an rotationally invariant k-means alignment algorithm. A fast approximation to the Earthmover's distance is employed, which is based on a weighted L1 distance between wavelet transforms. Compared with the Gaussian white noise case, where the L2 loss can be converted to a normalized probability, there is no such analytically convenient probabilitic transformation/interpretation with the Wasserstein loss. The appendix proves a useful result that provides a bound on how the L2 loss can be well behaved for smooth signals.

  * VAE approaches, with three types of generative priors (Variational Mixture of Posteriors, non-parametric exemplar-based, latent score-based generative models) used to infer heterogenity. The task focuses only on estimating heterogeneity (known pose, ctf).
  * Analysis methods are
    * map-to-map distance via FSC
    * In order to align ground truth latent to the learned latent embedding, an Affine transformation was optimized to tranform between them. See Eq. 10.
    * pairwise distance difference: this involves access to ground truth and estimated latents on images. Two pairwise matrices of distance in latent space are made: one for ground truth latent and one with latent embeddings. I.e. the elements of these matrices are the L2 distance between a pair of latent vectors. The Frobenius norm between these matrices is the overall distance metric. See Eq. 11. 
    * Within-cluster variance: multiple images had the same ground truth het latent (different poses, ctfs, etc). The latent embedding of these images had some variance among them, and this was quantified via RMSD, and the dispersion was visualized in a joint density plot
    * Point grid deformation: for discrate states, a center of each discrete state was computed by an arethmetical mean of the latent encodings. Then vectors were visualized on every discrete latent state in a plot. The magnitude of the vector is the distance between each center and the ground truth state. The direction of the vector is from the angle between the ground truth latent and the centre in PCA-map space.
  * Results show "representation with better conserved pairwise distances, less deformed latent distributions and lower within-cluster variances makes the latent space a more likely pseudo-conformational landscape to explore structural heterogeneity and infer potential biological reaction pathways"

  * Auto-decoder approach using one 3D reference map (learned from data), modified by vector field (convection, also learned from data). Each particle has its own convection (latent variable learned from data). Nice discussion of design choices that inspired confidence and is useful for methods developers in this area.

  * The authors propose a method that learns a conformational ensemble from synthetic cryo-EM measurements using a VAE approach with a multilayer perceptrons (MLP) neural network architecture and all distributions are Gaussian. They learn the 3D pose and conformation of an coarse grained atomic representation, where each amino acid residue is one Gaussian sphere. The global pose is the output from a deep encoder, after transforming to a $3\times 3$ rotation matrix by Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization. The conformational heterogenity is modelled with minimal inductive bias by a deep encoder that independently rotates and translates a residue independently of the others. After this, they regularize the output of the conformational encoder and keep it close to the reference conformation with a backbone continuity loss.
* Nashed, Y., Peck, A., Martel, J., Levy, A., Koo, B., Wetzstein, G., … Poitevin, F. (2022). Heterogeneous reconstruction of deformable atomic models in Cryo-EM.
  * The authors demonstrate that the anisotropic network model modes could capture the heterogeneity of adenylate kinase transitioning between open and closed states. A continuous trajectory was discreatly sampled in 50 states with a tool in a molecular viewer program to generate synthetic data. An autoencoder was used to estimate the up to 14 normal mode components, where the estimated values were used in a physics decoder. Other latent variables (rotation, CTF defocus, open conformation of atomic model) were provided and not inferred. The physics decoder represented the full atomic model with multiple Gaussians with atom-type specific parameters from established tabulated values. The elastic network model is computed on a subset of atoms, and then interpolated for the remaining atoms, avoiding the expensive diagonalization of the 3N × 3N Hessian, where N is the number of atoms.
